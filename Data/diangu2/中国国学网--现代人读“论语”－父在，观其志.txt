现代人读“论语”－父在，观其志
&nbsp; 
子曰，“父在，观其志；父没，观其行；三年无改于父道者，可谓孝矣。”
孔子说，“父亲在时，观其儿女们的志向；父亲离世，便观其儿女们的行为；三年不改变父亲的准则，便可说履行孝道了。”
The Master said,"When his farther was alive,he observed his aspirations;when his farther died,he observed his deeds.If,for three years,he dose not changes his farther`s Way,he may be said to be filial."
