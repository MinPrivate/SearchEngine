现代人读“论语”－仲弓问仁
仲弓问仁。子曰，“出门如见大宾，使民如承大祭。己所不欲，勿施于人。在邦无怨，在家无怨。”仲弓曰，“雍虽不敏，请事斯语矣。”
仲弓询问人，孔子说，“走出家门如同会见贵宾那样恭谨，役使百姓如同承办大祭那样敬肃。自己所不想干的事，不要强加于他人去做。在官府任职无人怨恨，在家闲居也无人怨恨。”仲弓说，“我虽然迟钝，但让我依您说的去做吧。”
When Zhong-gong asked about humanity,the Master said,"'Go abroad as if you were to receive a grand guest;employ the people as if you were charged with a grand sacrifice,''What you do no wish for yourslf, do not impose on others.'Thus,in a state,you will incur no resentment;in a noble house,you will incur no resentment,"Zhong-gong said,"Slow-witted as I am,I beg to practice this saying."
