现代人读“论语”－子之武城
&nbsp; 
子之武城，闻弦歌之声。夫子莞尔而笑，曰，“割鸡焉用牛刀？”子游对曰，“昔者偃也闻诸夫子月，‘君自学道则爱人，小人学道则易使也。’”子曰，“二三子！偃之言是也。前言戏之耳。”
孔子到武城去，听到弹琴唱歌的声音，便微笑着说，“杀鸡哪里用得着宰牛刀呢？”子游回答道，“以前我听老师说过，‘君自学了礼乐就会爱人，小人学了礼乐就容易听使唤。’”孔子说，“学生们，言偃的话是对的。我刚才讲的话不过是开玩笑罢了。”
When the Master went to Wu City,he heard the sounds of stringed instruments and clanting.The Master,with a gentle smile,said,"In killing a chicken,why need you use an ox-knife?"Zi-you replied,"Formerly I heard Master say,'If the gentleman acquires the Way,he loves men;if the small man acquires the Way,he is easily ruled.'"The Master said,"My disciples,what Yan said is correct.My previous remark was but a joke."
